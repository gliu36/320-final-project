    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "League of Legends (LoL) is a MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) published by Riot Games in 2009 and is the [most popular online PC game](https://newzoo.com/insights/rankings/top-20-core-pc-games/) as of November 2019. The competitive scene or e-sports has been popular among players and the most recent international tornament had an estimated 99.6 million viewers and had a $2.5 million prize pool for over 100 teams accross 13 regions around the world [(source)](https://www.businessinsider.com/league-of-legends-world-championship-winner-funplus-phoenix-photos-2019-11). There is an estimated >100 million matches of league played per day with 8 million concurrent players at any given time as of 2017 and that number as only gone up. As a result, the LoL has generated a plethora of data over the years and much can be learned from any perspective and purpose. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In our tutorial, we will looking at match and player data for the North American Server for the latest season as of December 2019. We will crawl the league API to gather and tidy up useful data to see if we can find any patterns. This will involve an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) to find any useful patterns such as predicting win rate and finding most important factor in winning a game. We hope that this tutorial can provide insight in how the Riot API works and to encourage new and experienced players to see how interconnected the field of data science and video games can really be. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - Traditional Competitive League of Legends (LoL) is played by 10 players with 2 sides (Blue and Red side) having 5 players each.\n",
    " - The objective is to destroy the opposing team's Nexus or base.\n",
    " - Each player chooses a \"champion\" (playable character) before the game starts. This champion is chosen in  mind to work with your team and your own strengths. At the time of this tutorial, there are [146 playable champions](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/champions/). \n",
    " - Each \"champion\" has a unique set of skills that can range from dealing tons of damage, healing, or applying \"crowd control\" buffs/debuffs (CC) such as stuns, binds, and freezes. \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " - Furthermore, each champion fall under a list of categories or classes. Some champions are exclusivly ranged marksman fighters, some are melee based and prefer to fight on the front lines, and some are magic based mages that cast spells as their primary way of damage. \n",
    " - The champion classes are listed [here](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/gameplay/taking-another-look-subclasses) and include Tanks, Fighters, Slayers, Mages, Controllers, and Marksmen. \n",
    " \n",
    " - To defeat the enemy base or Nexus, you must destroy at every turret in at least 1 lane (Top, Mid, Bottom). Then, you will need to destroy at least 1 inhibitor and both the Nexus turrets to finally break the enemy nexus open. \n",
    " - This process can take 15 minutes up to over an hour depending on how back and forth the game is going.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    " - At 1 minute 5 seconds, waves of \"minions\" will spawn every 30 seconds for each team and for each lane. These minions are controlled by the game's AI and have only a basic attacking skill (melee, caster, seige) that help their team's players take towers and progress the game. Once an inhibitor is destroyed for a certain lane, \"super\" minions start to spawn that make them very strong and help push lanes even more. \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " - Players will be given gold as the game progresses (passive income) and also awarded gold for killing enemy \"minions\" (also called creep), enemy champions (players), or capturing certain game objectives (towers, baron, first blood, ect). \n",
    " - This gold can be used to buy items in the shop to obtain powerful weapons and bonuses that can make your champion extremely strong.  \n",
    " \n",
    " - Players also get experience and level up from being in the area of enemy minion, player, or objective deaths. Each level (max 18) gives you more base stats and a skill point which can be used to level up your skills (usually max level 5, max level 3 for ultimate). These skill upgrades are cruicial to winning the game as they provide more damage, longer CC, more healing, ect. \n",
    " \n",
    " - Most champions (some are unique) have an ultimate ability (unlocked at level 6) that have longer cooldowns but can significantly sway the course of a match. \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "We've only listed the basics and there's so much more to learn about the game, it's community, and the compeitive scene. You can learn more at https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Required Libraries/Resources\n",
    "\n",
    " - All libraries and code will be imported/written with python 3 in mind. If you have python 2, use the future library or upgrade :D\n",
    " - To scrape League of Legends data, we need requets, beautifulsoup4, and json\n",
    " - Pandas and Numpy will be used to transform and tidy our dataset\n",
    " - matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization\n",
    " - sklearn for predictions and machine learning\n",
    " - urllib for converting characters in string into escaped characters (for hitting the API)\n",
    " - time to sleep for rate limit\n",
    " - random to randomly crawl riot api\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " - We need an API key to access the Riot API. We will load it from a hidden file called 'api_key.json'. Generate yours at https://developer.riotgames.com/. "

    "# 3. Data Collection (API Crawling)\n",
    "\n",
    "To gather match data, Riot provides an [API](https://developer.riotgames.com/apis) that has data for matches, players (summoners), champions (playable characters), ect.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " ## Using Riot's API\n",
    " \n",
    " - Riot has a [developer portal](https://developer.riotgames.com/) which you will need a Riot [account](https://developer.riotgames.com/login). \n",
    " - You will need an API Key and generate it daily or [apply for a product API key](https://developer.riotgames.com/app-type) which will persist.\n",
    " - Documentation can be found at https://developer.riotgames.com/apis\n",
    " - Riot has rate limits of 20 requests/second and 100 requests/2 min. Data generation will take a while to generate enough data to learn on. Therefore, we will export data into a file to pull from while generating data as often as we can. \n",
    " - Example for calling summoner (player) information for current API version (v4):\n",
    "     - https://na1.api.riotgames.com/lol/summoner/v4/summoners/by-name/SUMMONER_NAME?api_key= + API_KEY\n",
    "     \n",
    "     \n",
    "### \"Random\" Game Data\n",
    " \n",
    " - Riot only provides game data from a given gameID which cannot be randomly gotten. Therefore, we need to start from a seeded playerID and crawl through that players' teammates and opponents games to generate enough data to preform data analysis.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " - Our set seed will be on one of our summoner IDs \"50g Tibbers\" on the North American server. \n",

    "        \n",
    "        Will output matchData.csv with match data and log.txt for any troubleshooting\n",
    "        - Will return pandas DataFrame with data on a given # of matches (int: num_matches=100)\n",
    "        - Needs a seed summoner to start API Crawling (string: seed_summoner)\n",
    "        - Needs your riot API key to pull requests with (string: key=API_KEY)\n",
    "        - Need a valid league of legends region (string: region='na1')\n",
    "        - Needs a valid season # to pull correct matches from (int: season=13)\n",
    "        - Between matches, function will sleep to account for API latency (float: sleep_delay=0.2)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - tidy_game_data(match, region, key)\n",
    "        - Given a league of legends match, transform into a pandas DataFrame and return\n",
    "        - 10 rows = 10 players and their stats (see PARAMS global for column names)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - get_match_history(region, accountId, key)\n",
    "        - Given an accountId, return match history of account\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - get_match_info(region, matchId, key)\n",
    "        - Given matchId, return match information from API\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - transform_match(match, visited_players, region, key, seed=None)\n",
    "        - From a match, select the next accountId to continue API crawl\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - get_most_recent_valid(match_history, visited_matches, correct_queues, season, visited_players)\n",
    "        - Recursively find the most recent valid match from match history\n",
    "        - If invalid history found, will continue to crawl on a randomly seen summoner"
